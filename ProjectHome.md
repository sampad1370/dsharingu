**DSharingu** is a desktop/screen sharing application.
It's made to be simple and to reduce the firewall issues.
With DSharingu there is no client and server concept. This program allows for either or both caller and callee to administer the other computer remotely.
I created this software to help my family in Italy with their computer issues as their Internet provider doesn't allow to accept incoming connections.
