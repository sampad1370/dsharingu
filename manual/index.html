		<p>This software allows two people to look into each other's PC screen. The main 
			feature lies in the ability for either or both the caller or the answerer to 
			interact with the remote's PC.<br>
			I wrote this because family's connection in Italy is firewalled by the ISP. 
			Making it impossible for me to connect to their PCs to do administer them.<br>
			This software is very simple and it doesn't attempt to do anything behind the 
			users' back. It does not contain any spyware, nagware or whatever.

		<h3 align="center"><strong>Quick Start </strong>
		</h3>
		<center><font color="#ff0000" size="+1"><strong>BIG FAT WARNING !</font><br>
			<font color="#ff0000">Use a strong password and be really really sure that the 
				remote party is indeed someone that you can trust !!!</STRONG></font></center>
		<p align="center">You are either a <em>caller</em> or a <em>answerer</em>.
		</p>
		<p>For the <strong><em>caller</em></strong> (example: the family behind firewall):
		</p>
		<p>1) Run DSharingu.<br>
			2) Click on the button <b>Settings...</b><br>
			3) Insert the destination IP (given to you by the <em>answerer</em><A href="#note1">*</A>).<br>
			3) Choose if you want to show your screen (<strong>on</strong> by default, 
			leave it like that).<br>
			4) Choose if you want to share the control of your PC (<strong>on</strong> by 
			default, leave it like that but <strong>make sure you can trust the remote party</strong>).<br>
			5) Set a password that you'll give to the remote.<br>
			6) Choose if you want to see the remote's desk (<strong>on</strong> by default, 
			set it to <strong>off</strong>).<br>
			7) Click <strong>OK</strong> to close the <strong>Settings</strong> dialog.
			<br>
			8) Click on <strong>Call...</strong> and hopefully the connection will go 
			through.
			<br>
			<!-- <IMG src="settings_needing_help.png"> -->
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>For the <strong><em>answerer</em></strong> (the family computer wiz that wants 
			to help the family):</p>
		<p>1) Run DSharingu.<br>
			2) Click on the button <b>Settings...</b> you are going to get called, so, <strong>no</strong>
			need to enter any IP here.<br>
			3) Choose if you want to show and/or share your screen (<strong>on</strong> by 
			default, you probably want to change this to <strong>off</strong>)<br>
			4) Choose if you want to see the remote's screen (<strong>off</strong> by 
			default, you probably want to change this to <strong>on</strong>).<br>
			5) Give your IP to the family <A href="#note1">*</A><br>
			6) Patiently wait for the call...<br>
			<!-- <IMG src="settings_giving_help.png"></p> -->
		<p>This is only one scenario of course. One can play with the settings at will, but 
			I generally just want to cover the case the program has been designed for.
		</p>
		<p><a name="note1">*</a> Personally I user <a href="http://www.dyndns.com/" target="_blank">
				DyDNS</a>. It's very useful to have the less computer-literate people call 
			you at a fixed readable address, rather than a numeric IP !</p>
		<HR noShade>
		<H3 align="center"><STRONG>Known issues</STRONG></H3>
		<P>- Currently, <STRONG>interaction</STRONG> is only possible throught <STRONG>mouse</STRONG>
			. Keyboard support will come later.<BR>
			- When opening the About and Settings <STRONG>dialogs</STRONG> of the remote 
			instance of the program, <STRONG>images will stop coming</STRONG> (modal 
			dialogs stop the main gameflow, will fix in next version).<BR>
			- Very high bandwidth is still required.<BR>
			<BR>
			<hr noShade>
		<P></P>
		<h3 align="center"><strong>Requirements for a&nbsp;smooth usage </strong>
		</h3>
		<p>- Windows XP/2000 (currently only tested on Windows XP).<br>
			- A decent graphic chip with basic OpenGL support (better if you have recent 
			video-card drivers anyway !).<br>
			- A non-ancient system: 1GHz CPU and 512MB of RAM.<br>
			- When running through the Internet, DSL/Cable connection or better.</p>
